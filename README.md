# Stock-Trend-Prediction

Stock_Market_Analysis.ipynb file contains all the Python code and keras_model.h5 is a trained model.

I have created a Stock Trend Prediction Web Application in Python. Here I have used Streamlit, an open-source Python library, that makes it easy to build beautiful custom web apps for Machine Learning and Data Science. 

Source of data:
I have taken the stock data from Yahoo Finance.

About the model and the Stramlit Application: 
I have used 70% data for training and 30% data for testing. I have increased the accuracy of the model by 25% and the current accuracy of the model is 91%.  The model collects data from the past 10 years and up to the current date. I have plotted the moving average for 100 days and 200 days. The Streamlit application is user-based, the users can predict any stock as per their choice.
